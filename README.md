# REACT-APP <!-- omit in toc -->

## Recipe website

This is a responsive website that displays information from different recipes. This information is extracted from the Spoonacular API.

The app uses the React JavaScript library because of its focus on component reuse, its use of virutal DOM and the ability to render on the server, in addition to its large community and ecosystem.

Other libraries used are:

- Axios for handling HTTP requests.
- React-Query to manage cache and data management in the application.
- React-Loading-Skeleton to display a load skeleton while getting the src from the images.
- React-Router-Dom to manage routes in the app.
- Sass to add custom styles.
- React-Icons to add icons to the user inferface.
- SweetAlert2 to display custom alerts and messages.

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/).

First, you will need to clone the repo:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/imarti01/react-app.git
```

Run `npm i` in the terminal to install the dependencies.

Then, run `npm run dev` to start up the app.
